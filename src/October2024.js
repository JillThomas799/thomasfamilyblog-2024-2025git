              and so for this month's display we have returned to using Scaleable Vector Graphics (SVG) to create

              codes to create the display.

              It is always a bit of a sad time of a year when we reach autumn, but there are some gorgeous colours and the colour 
              of the trees around the tarn are beautiful.
              <br />
              <br />
              Anyway, it is a busy month this month as we have a number of visitors coming up to Cumbria and we are looking forward to meeting with friends 
              in Manchester to go to see Rest is Politics live at the Manchester O2 arena. We also have our Penrith train tickets booked to
              go to London for the day to see The Silk Roads Exhibition at the British Museum.

            <section className="newsOctober" style={{textAlign:"center"}}>
             Today was our long-awaited trip to try travelling down to London and back for the day via train to see the  <Link to="https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions/silk-roads"
             target="_blank" title="Click here to discover more about the Silk Roads Exhibition at the British Museum" className="LinkOctober2024">Silk Roads Exhibition</Link> at the British Museum. 
             This meant a <em>very</em> early start from home to be safely parked and on the platform at Penrith station for the 7.02 fast, direct train into London Euston station.
             The outward journey went without incident and we arrived safely in London with just 10 minutes delay at 10.20am. We had chosen a quiet
             carriage, which lived up to expectations as it was being  used by  people travelling with work, so it was lovely and peaceful and there was plenty of time to read a number of chapters
             of Peter Frankopan's book <Link to="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Silk-Roads-New-History-World-ebook/dp/B00XN8UG3C/ref=sr_1_3?crid=36BQTJ2JO6U77&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.eNYkQIU_YOMC2oj8GPXFA5f4g_V9_38XUTCynUbULm-itFUmkQPgkw4clMPRW77IOrXo0lBQHBxDZcP8AR8v-sK0TIvrVypO2q-f9sotTWB-SlPEnrBfvkwpfB-XqGlUf4l71oQdjZDY8Z7KMWelA_-_wJPfoDbb-hEPv5QY9WEQTEN1gCgqx_W_JFnmB15gdvGx3SnvjzLVvPqt4cu7KBSsoSeXL1ntXUZYL9sHz_I.uOv5D7-1cCLEM4UHgjNEXT6-730kyGOjCr6R1WaTDU4&dib_tag=se&keywords=silk+roads&nsdOptOutParam=true&qid=1728051135&sprefix=silk+roads%2Caps%2C277&sr=8-3"
             target="_blank" title="Click here to discover more about Peter Frankopan's 'The Silk Roads A New History of the World'"className="LinkOctober2024">The Silk Roads A New History of the World</Link> , which subsequently proved very useful when
             going around the exhibition.
             <br />
             <br />
             As we are current members of the British Museum, which includes entry to special exhibitons, we had the advantage of not needing to book or queue outside 
             and we also made use of our access (on weekdays) to the very pleasant members' room upstairs which has its own café and is more spacious and quieter
             than the general café areas within the complex. It also gives us a 10% discount off purchases in the shops and cafés  and restaurants at the museum, so what better
             reason for buying further books in the shop!
             <br />
             <br />
             The exhibition itself was very well done and presented. Our prior reading also really helped us understand the history better. The exhibition itself,
             as usual with popular British Museum exhibitions, was busy and quite slow moving so it is worth allowing sufficient time and being prepared for that.
             Some of the photos from the exhibition are included in the album below. Once we had finished the exhibition we had lunch at the  
             <Link to="https://www.britishmuseum.org/visit/food-and-drink/great-court-restaurant" target="_blank" title="Click here to discover more about the Great Court Restaurant"
             className="LinkOctober2024"> Great Court Restaurant</Link> at the museum, which was very pleasant. It is best to book a table in advance as we did, as it is busy.
             <br />
             <br />
             In the afternoon, we decided to have a change from museum-visiting and walk over to Covent garden, which in retrospect was maybe not such a good idea as it 
             was absolutely pouring with rain, and despite having umbrellas we got very wet. We were quite glad therefore to finally arrive back at Euston station
             for our return journey home.
             Our return journey as predicted, did not run as smoothly as the outward journey. Avanti West Coast were undertaking what would appear to be their not 
             uncommon approach of cancelling trains at short notice and then suddenly reinstating them with about 3 minutes to spare. Whilst it must be very difficult to keep all the 
             trains and networks running to time and linking up throughout the day, as incidents crop up en route (in this case a broken rail earlier in the day),
             it did seem that the way this was handled at the managment level was may be not the most productive for everyone concerned. However, in all fairness to Avanti West Coast,
             despite the final delay being over an hour, the process of claiming a delay repayment has proved straightforward and the repayment sum reasonable. The staff also worked hard
             to make sure everyone was aware of their onward connection arrangements for returning home safely that evening.
             <br />
             <br />
             All in all, we had a great day, and would definitely go again.

            <section className="newsOctober" style={{textAlign:"center"}}>
             Today it was time for our long awaited trip with friends to see the Rest of Politics Live Show with Alistair Campbell and Rory Stewart, 
             and also Katty Kay and Anthony Scaramucci (former White House Director of Communications for Donald Trump) who host The Rest is Politics: US Edition, at the O2 Apollo Theatre, Manchester.
             <br />
             <br />
             We had an early start to pick up Elena and then to drive down to meet and have a lovely lunch at our friends' house. We then headed off into Manchester to try and find some parking 
             near the O2 Apollo Theatre. It was recommended that we only park on the official O2 car parks, as there are some alternative car parks where there have been reports 
             of scams. Thankfully, as it was relatively small, we managed to get onto one of the official O2 car parks where we were shown to our place by an extremely entertaining and amusing car park attendant.
             <br />
             <br />
            We were met by an amazing view of a queue of people stretching indefinitely, waiting to enter the theatre, which just did not seem to decrease as people moved into the theatre.
            It was a phenomenal sight as, whilst we had expected it to be busy, we had not expected the sort of turn out you would expect for someone with pop start status!
            <br />
             <br />
             Meanwhile Robin had spotted the Apsley Cottage pub, where he used to go drinking as a student.... So of course, it needed checking out for old times sake. By the time
             we finally entered the Apollo Theatre, it was almost time for the show to start. We were pleased to see we had good seats with a great view. The first half was Alistair and 
             Rory, then there was an interval and for the second half they were joined by Katty Kay and Anthony Scaramucci (former White House Director of Communications for Donald Trump), hosts of The Rest is Politics: US Edition
             for a question and answer session.
             <br />
             <br />
             It was a brilliant day out which everyone thoroughly enjoyed. It was a long drive back home in the evening, but it had been well worth the effort.

             <section className="newsheaderOctober">    THE DAY OF NO WATER......!</section> 
            <section className="newsOctober" style={{textAlign:"center"}}>
            We woke this morning and went to turn on the shower only to discover.....there was no water!<br /> <br /> 
            We went to explore what the problem might be and soon identified the source, as overnight we appeared to have developed a new garden feature .... a spring, 
            so it was time to identify who was responsible for the maintenance and repair of the affected part of the network and a number of urgent telephone calls ensued.
            <br /> 
            <br />             
            We discovered that it was the water company, United Utilities who needed to come out to assess and undertake the repair. With all due respect to United Utilities it was 
            a reasonably efficient process with us being updated by text every step of the way. 
            <br /> 
            <br />  
            They have 3 teams; the first to come and assess the problem, the second team to undertake
            the repair and the third team to undertake the back-fill and tidying of the site to how it was before. 
            Teams 1 and 2 came out very promptly that day, not least because our supply appeared to be a high-pressure supply
            , suitable for manning a fire-hydrant should there be a fire at the farm at our rear or at our 4 properties on the hill. This meant that 
            United Utilities were losing a significant amount of water per minute from their supply. Apparently the problem was that a stopcock had sheared and broken,
            so once this had been identified, repair was soon underway and before long the water supply reestablished.
