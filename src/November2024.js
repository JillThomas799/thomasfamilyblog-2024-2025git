           Welcome to our November blog. This month we have created a virtual, animated bonfire and firework display for our Guy Fawke's party. This
           way, Lennie can be included too as he hates the noise of real fireworks. He has already organised for us to put on <Link to="https://www.classicfm.com/radio/shows-presenters/pet-classics/"
           target="_blank" title="Click here to discover more about the annual Pet's Classics programme on Classic FM" className="LinkNovember">Pet's Classics on Classic FM </Link> 
           at 17.00 on the 2nd and 5th of November 2024, to help keep him relaxed. He loves this programme.
           <br />
           <br />
                      For the winter months we have also included a colour scheme taken once again from an autumnal russet pallet in hex color coding.
           The display is created by amalgamating 3 separate container elements: the  burning bonfire animation, the animated firework display, 
           and the earth which forms the ground. We hope you enjoy it...

             <section className="newsheaderNovember"> VISIT TO THE SYCAMORE GAP EXHIBITION AT THE SILL</section> 
            <section className="newsNovember" style={{textAlign:"center"}}> We took the time today to go to see the temporary exhibition entitled 'Sycamore Gap: One Year On'
            by the artist Charlie Whinney which is being hosted at 'The Sill' between the 28th September and the 3rd November 2024. The Guardian newspaper recently 
            published an article regarding this exhibition which can be read here: <Link to="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/27/sycamore-gap-tree-exhibition-opens-to-mark-a-year-since-its-felling"

            <br />
            <br />
            The felling of the Sycamore Gap Tree in the early hours of the morning on the 28th September 2023 gained widespread media coverage with people from all over the world adding 
            their contributions as to the significance of this particular tree to their lives and experiences. As a result of this and in order to try and gain something hopeful and positive 
            out of such a destructive event, the artist Charlie Whinney and Creative Communities CIC, have created the Sycamore Gap: One Year On exhibition. 
            <br /> 
            <br />  
            This exhibition encourages contemplation of events and features the largest remaining section of the original tree. 
            As part of the exhibition, it seeks the participation of the public with visitors being invited to make promises to nature, which will be incorporated into the second and final phase of the commission, set to open by Easter 2025. 
            It is the first part of a 2 part exhibition in which the second and final part will see the wood installed permanently into The Sill and this will open by Easter 2025.
            <br /> 
            <br />  
            As part of the Trees of Hope initiative, all 15 UK National Parks will also receive a sapling that will find new homes 
            in some of the most beautiful landscapes in the UK.

             <section className="newsNovember" style={{textAlign:"center"}}>
           When we walked the Birdowswald Fort section of Hadrian's Wall on the 28th July 2024, there was not time to call in and explore the fort more fully, so we promised
           that sometime over the quieter Winter months we would pay Birdoswald Fort a visit, especially as Harry had never had the opportunity to visit.
            <br /> 
            <br />  
            It was lovely and quiet at the fort, so there was plenty of opportunity and time to study the information boards and findings carefully. 
            It is an interesting fort and well worth a visit if you are in the area! It is probably worthwhile obtaining a copy of the English Heritage guidebook 
            though as it contains some additional helpful information to provide further clarification.
