                  Apologies for the delay in posting this month's blog but we have been very busy. Not with anything very interesting I am afraid,
                  just a number of more difficult routine matters which have taken a period of time to sort out.....
                  <br /> 
                  <br /> 
                  Anyhow, here we are at last and would like to introduce our 
                  new 'pet', a pheasant which has decided  it really likes our garden. I think this may be because we hang bird feeders out for the smaller birds,
                  who eat the seeds and nuts and in the process drop the seed on to the floor. The pheasant then comes along several times a day 
                  to eat all the dropped seed. Every morning now we look out of the kitchen window to see the pheasant slowly making its way up our drive to have its breakfast.
                    <br /> 
                    <br /> 
                    Our header picture for this month is therefore our pet garden pheasant. This has taken a while to construct as it is a little complicated and there is still
                    more work to be done but I thought I would get this update posted and I can continue to work on improving the design as the month continues....

                     <section className="newsheaderMarch2025"> VISIT TO AUCKLAND PALACE AND BISHOPS AUCKLAND</section> 
                    <section className="newsMarch2025" style={{textAlign:"left"}}>Auckland Palace was the residence of the Prince Bishops of Durham from approximately 1183 and was their primary residence
                      from 1832 to 2012 when the Castle and its contents were sold to the Auckland Castle Trust, now known as the Auckland Project. It still houses the Bishop's offices. It is one of the best-preserved Bishop's palaces in Europe.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      The displays and information boards throughout the Palace provide information about the individual Bishops in a chronological order. Auckland Palace was only the home of the individual
                      Prince Bishop of Durham for as long as they held office, it did not belong to them and could not be passed on to their offspring.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      The status of the Prince Bishops was unique as they had a social rank on a par with a duke and political power exceeded only by the monarch.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      This was, although a long(ish) drive, an enjoyable day out as we had never visited before. We used our historic houses membership for entry. This gained us entry to the house 
                      but not to the tower and all the exhibitions.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      The Palace displays are laid out in a very interesting manner with plenty of helpful information boards. The 12 paintings by Zurbarán of Jacob and his sons (well, 9 were present actually as Joseph and Asher
                      have gone to the National Gallery in London for conservation work, and the painting of Benjamin is a copy), are very impressive and are hung in the long dining room.

                     <section className="newsheaderMarch2025"> VISIT TO RELATIVES DOWN SOUTH INCLUDING A DAY OUT TO SUTTON HOO SUFFOLK.</section> 
                    <section className="newsMarch2025" style={{textAlign:"left"}}> We have just returned from a visit down to the South and South East visiting relatives, and 
                      whilst there took the opportunity to go and visit <Link to="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/suffolk/sutton-hoo" className="LinkMarch2025"> Sutton Hoo </Link> in Suffolk. It is a really interesting location and well worth a visit for anyone 
                      who has not been. We lasted visited the site back in 2009 and had been meaning to revisit for sometime but unfortunately it is only open at weekends 
                      over the winter period, so this was the first opportunity that we had had. 
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      I will not write too much here about the history of Sutton Hoo and the findings there because there is plenty of information on the site accessed by the link above and online, suffice it to 
                      say that Sutton Hoo is the site of an Anglo-Saxon burial ground dating back to the 6th and 7th centuries. Excavations in 1939, just as World War 2 was starting, revealed an Anglo-Saxon ship burial 
                      containing many treasures in what came to be called 'Mound 1'. It is thought, due to the riches found buried there, that it was most likely the grave of Raedwald, an east Anglian king who died in the 620s. This is one of only three Anglo-Saxon 
                      ship burials in this country. The second and lesser ship burial was found at Sutton Hoo in Mound Two and the other was found in nearby Snape.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      One of the conditions of the National Trust owning the Sutton Hoo site is that the site has to have an educational purpose, so we had a fantastic local guide Catriona
                      who was one of the original excavating team of Mound 2 back in the 1980s. She was very interesting and entertaining in our hour long talk and it was fascinating to hear about life on the dig back then.
                      If anyone is a Time Team fan, <Link to="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/suffolk/sutton-hoo/time-team-announcement" target="_blank" className="LinkMarch2025"> Time Team </Link> are back on the site from the 19th May 2025 - 13th June 2025.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Following on from our visit to Sutton Hoo we caught up with the 2021 film <Link to="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/suffolk/sutton-hoo/digging-the-dirt-at-sutton-hoo-the-true-story-behind-the-dig" target="_blank" className="LinkMarch2025">'The Dig'</Link> starring Ralph Fiennes as the archeologist Basil Brown 
                      exploring the story of the excavation of the Great Ship Burial at Sutton Hoo in 1939 and which is currently available on Netflix.
                      It is an enjoyable film in its own right which, whilst it is based on a true story and accurately portrays the Sutton Hoo excavation, it is a also in parts a fictionalized account with liberties taken for dramatic purposes especially with the relationships between certain of the characters 
                      and the addition of fictional characters such as Rory Lomax who were added for dramatic effect.  We felt that it was a pity it was not able to be filmed on site using Tranmer House. There is an interesting article 
                      <Link to="https://www.eadt.co.uk/news/21324495.ralph-fiennes-basil-brown-remarkable-man/" target="_blank" className="LinkMarch2025"> here </Link> in the East Anglian Times about 
                      Ralph Fiennes when he was preparing for the film.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Whilst visiting in the South East, we were also able to catch up on progress with Jill's relatives garden project, which is making good progress.

                    <section className="newsMarch2025" style={{textAlign:"left"}}>
                      Elena has for some time expressed the desire to introduce a pet into her home, it has just been a case of her deciding which pet would be best...
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      As might be imagined, various family members and friends have had their own suggestions to offer including Harry who initially suggested chickens, despite
                      being informed by Jill that these now have to be <Link to = "https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-as-a-keeper-of-less-than-50-poultry-or-other-captive-birds" target="_blank"
                      className="LinkMarch2025" > registered with Defra </Link> and a pheasant (again needs to be registered with Defra). He then moved on to sheep (numerous reasons this is not possible including, but not limited to, it not being permitted in the property deeds, and having to
                      register your premises with the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) and obtain a CPH number.) 
                     <br />
                     <br />
                      There is of course also the question of who would be looking after 
                      said pet when Elena goes away ..... Jill has refused point black to undertake any rat care but would (possibly) be prepared to mind a cute exotic hamster....
                      There had been one of the latter in the local pet shop which would jump on its wheel and show off, looking super cute. However, needless to say, this hamster was very quickly sold whilst the rat was still there (say no more).....

                <li><strong className="titlesMarch2025">Parking:</strong> We parked on the pay and display car park by the tourist centre (GPS NU 256198) on entering Craster village. 
                Currently it costs £9.00 for the day but it is important to note that the machines accept CASH ONLY. This car park can get <em>very</em> busy so best to arrive promptly.
                However given the weather,today on arrival, it was still fairly quiet....

                <br />
                <li><strong className="titlesMarch2025">Paths:</strong> The route consists of an amalgamation of 2 separate walks. The first is an 8 mile circuit walking 
                south from Craster and following the English Coastal Path and St Oswalds Way as far as Longhoughton beach where it is necessary to turn inland
                and head towards Longhoughton village before returning to Craster via Howick Hall and across the fields to South Craster Farm and Arnold Nature Reserve.
                <br />
                The second half of the walk is a 4 mile circuit walking over to Dunstanburgh Castle and  heading onwards as far as Dunstan Steads before cutting back towards Craster village.
                <br />
                The route and is on clear paths, tracks and lanes. It is well-signposted.</li>

                     <section className="newsheaderMarch2025"> DAY OUT AT LOWTHER CASTLE WITH FRIENDS ROBIN AND CATHY</section> 
                    <section className="newsMarch2025" style={{textAlign:"left"}}> Had a great day out at Lowther Castle today with our friends Robin and Cathy.
                      For those who remember, in February 2024 Robin and Cathy's 2 dogs Wilf and Nell featured as stars in the blog.
                      This time though they were safely being looked after at home, so we have added their pictures from last year to represent them as they were not able to be 
                      with us this time.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      It was an early start because we had decided to call off first at <Link to = "https://larchcottage.co.uk/" target="_blank" className="LinkMarch2025">Larch Cottage Nurseries </Link>
                       at Melkinthorpe to acquire a couple more trees for the slope in our garden. Larch Cottage Nurseries is a garden centre with a difference as it has an array of interesting statues
                       but also a number of plants. shrubs and trees which are not available at more standard garden centre. As a result, we ended up buying 2 new trees for the garden slope:
                       an acer brilliantissimum and a prunus pink perfection flowering cherry together with some forget me not plants for the garden balcony boxes. 
                       The nursery has an italian café called <Link to="https://larchcottage.co.uk/casa-verde/" target="_blank" className="LinkMarch2025"> La Casa Verde </Link> , which also serves coffees 
                       so this was a good opportunity for some light refreshment and to meet their resident feline (see photos below).
                       <br />
                       <br />
                       Cathy and Robin had not visited Lowther Castle before and were saying how good it was as an attraction and in terms of location.
                       We discovered Lowther Castle on 1st June 2011 when we spent a short holiday in the nearby village of Helton and wanted to explore 
                       further the ruined building and estate we could see across the valley. Looking back we must have been one of the first public visitors
                       as after a £9 million pound restoration project the castle and some of the garden were opened to the public on the 22nd April 2011 for the first time since 1938. 
                       At that time, Lowther was in the early stages of its renovations with many of the areas of the gardens still overgrown and only a very small café. Newcastle 
                       University archives have some interesing further information about Lowther Castle <Link to="https://co-curate.ncl.ac.uk/lowther-castle/"
                       target="_blank" className="LinkMarch2025"> here </Link> . A couple of the photos of Lowther Castle at the time of our 2011 visit are included below.
                       <br />
                       <br />
                       The reimagination of the gardens at Lowther has been part of a 20 year plan initiated in 2008 by the gardener designer Dan Pearson
                       More recently, the rose garden has been completed, together with the Japanese garden. There is also the creation of a scented garden.

                     <section className="newsheaderMarch2025"> WEEK 9  OF CAMINO TRAINING: DAYS 1 AND 2 SEQUENTIAL LONG WALKS PLUS ALSO MOTHER'S DAY</section> 
                    <section className="newsMarch2025" style={{textAlign:"left"}}> We are now into week 9 of our recommended training program for the Camino de Santiago...that is a slighty scary thought!
                      Over the forthcoming weeks we have to increase steadily the length of our long weekend walks and start undertaking these on consecutive days without a break.
                      This week's target for the longer weekend walks was one walk of 4 hours and one walk of three hours. For these we chose a 10 mile walk and a more challenging but
                       slightly shorter 7 miles walks on the Saturday and Sunday respectively. Both were very enjoyable although the second walk, whilst shorter, seemed by far the harder of the two. 
                       Even the google fit app agreed and sent us a message saying 'whew, that was intense!'......and we agreed with it! It was a good demonstration though
                       that we need to continue working on and improving our fitness and stamina over the forthcoming weeks.....
                       <br />
                       <br />
                       Also this weekend was mother' day and Elena and Harry had bought some lovely cards and Harry had baked a very impressive chocolate and rum ganache cake as can be seen in the attached photo album....
