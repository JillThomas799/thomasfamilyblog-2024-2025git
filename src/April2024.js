            <section className="news">Welcome to our April 2024 blog launched from our new site! We hope you like the site's new look and improved functionality. 
            Please note and bookmark the new web address which is displayed in your browser above.
            <br />
            <br />
            This month's theme is the local North Cumbrian Swaledale sheep in the area where we live and their very cute lambs who have been entertaining us, gambling around in the fields recently. 
            Swaledale sheep are a breed of sheep named after the Yorkshire valley of Swaledale in England. In this area of Northern Cumbria, 
            which is located in the Pennine fells of Cumbria, they are the main breed of sheep to be reared. They are especially suited to this area
            as they are very hardy, able-bodied, thick-coated and bold. More information about Swaledales can be found <Link Link to = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaledale_sheep" target="_blank" title="Please click here to discover more about Swaledale sheep"><strong>here</strong></Link>.
            <br />
            <br />
            For those people who may be interested, the April header design this month has been created from first-principals using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). Firstly, pictures were taken of the local Swaledale sheep and their lambs, then the mountains,
            sheep and lambs were carefully plotted and their colours and features matched as closely as possible. The new site uses React, a javascript library which allows a webpage to be described using small, reusable components. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Meanwhile, the Easter weekend has brought us some pleasanter weather. The daffodils are in bloom in the village and people are out and about, smiling, cheerful and chatty, catching up on local news after the windy and wet early Spring.
            The daffodils are always lovely and the grass the fresh green of early Spring.

            <section className="news">

            <br />
            In our 16th March blog entry, we went out to the Greek restaurant in Carlisle for our Mother's Day meal and we enclosed a photo of the very popular and well-known cat, whom the 
            pet shop on Bank Street feeds and look after (see below for those people who missed the photos first time around). 
            <br />
            <br />
            We have since discovered and regret having to announce that he sadly died peacefully of old-age 10 days later on the 26th March, 2024, at the grand old cat-age of 16 years. His name was Will and he had adopted Nixon's pet shop 
            on Bank Street as his owners some years ago. He featured in a full article in the local paper which you can read by opening the link below and which 
            tells how he used to sleep in the cat baskets and curl up on the counter near the treats :

            <br />
            <br />
            He was known by many of the local population and has received some lovely 
            epitaphs, including the poem below which says:
            <br />
            <br />
            <em>"
              When tomorrow 
              <br />
              starts
              <br />
              without me
              <br />
              Don't think we're

              For every time you
              <br />
              think of me
              <br />

            <br />
            <br />
            and the beautiful Cumbrian felt picture of Will (shown below) a local artist has created of him with the inscription:

            <br />
            <section className="news">There are signs that Spring is arriving at last with the arrival of the blossom on the trees and the daffodils. Also just as importantly, the arrival of our first outing to meet with friends this year. 
            <br />
            <br />
            An old favourite, Sizergh Castle in South Cumbria was selected as our venue, not least because it has a good café, <em>(we know, we know...it always seems to be about the café...but these things are important)</em>, and there are a range of walks with some spectacular views on offer. 
            <br />
            <br />
            It was great to meet up with our friends, one of whom Jill has known since she was 11 years old and was bridesmaid at our wedding, and to catch up on news. There were some rainy showers, so for the first time we also 
            looked around the interior of Sizergh Castle, which was worth seeing. It was very busy as it was still the Easter holidays. By after lunch the weather had brightened, though it remained quite stormy, so we 
            worked out a relatively tree-free route up to <Link to = "https://www.nationalchurchestrust.org/church/st-john-evangelist-helsington" target="_blank" title="Click here to discover more about St John the Evangelist Church, Hetherington">St John the Evangelist Church, Hetherington</Link>, from where
            there are fantastic, sweeping views across to Morecambe Bay, the Lyth Valley and the distant Lakeland Fells. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Sizergh Castle remains one of our favourite National Trust properties, probably because of its size (it is relatively small), and the fact there are a variety of mixed-level walks which can be undertaken. It is also quite accessible, not being far off the M6 Junction 36 exit. 
            It is quite a popular location for visitors, as can be seen from the <Link to = "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g186326-d218255-Reviews-or10-Sizergh_Castle-Kendal_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html" target="_blank">Trip Advisor Reviews</Link>. </section>

            <section className="news">It was lovely to meet up in our home with our long-standing friends Pat and Dermot and their (quite crazy, but adorable) dog Archie today,
            and a good opportunity to catch up on all the news. We really enjoyed our day, walking about 6 miles. We saw plenty of lambs, but unfortunately not the ducklings on the tarn on this occasion.

            <br />
            We had to have a pre-prepared plan for how we would manage Lennie for the day, as he is a little unsure about dogs, and we did not want it to turn out

            Fortunately, he was not around when Archie was finishing off his food from his bowl in the kitchen....
            However, by the next morning Lennie seemed to have recovered ....(see photos below).

              We had a very pleasant trip to Lowther castle today. It was time for renewal of our annual membership, so this year we have obtained 
              <Link to = "https://www.historichouses.org/become-a-member/" target="_blank" title="Click here to discover more about Historic Houses membership"> Historic Houses membership</Link>,
              which not only gains us entrance to Lowther Castle, but also <Link to="https://www.historichouses.org/houses/?q=penrith" target ="_blank"
              title="Click here to discover some of the houses to which Historic Houses membership will gain you entrance">many other Historic Houses</Link>. 
              So that is all a bonus.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Firstly, we explored the new, revamped Lowther Exhibition which tells the story of Lowther and has just been fully opened. We felt it has been done really well. 
              In contrast to the design of the previous exhibition, the story of Lowther and its renovation is told through objects. 
              The rooms are dark and the graphics gold. There is also an interesting video to watch. So this is well worth a visit.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Then as we came out from within the Castle into the Parterre Gardens, 
              we caught our first glimpse of the Durham artist Steven Massam's temporary exhibition 'Celebration in Gold'. It is on site until the 6th May 2024. More information about Steven Massam and 
              this exhibition can be found in this BBC article  <Link to = "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz96n7n1revo" target="_blank">'Massive gold flag artwork opens to public at castle'</Link>.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The renovation of the Japanese Garden is nearing its completion. We have been watching its progress with interest for some months,
              but it is really lovely now and certainly a transformation on how it was before. It has been created to be an area of relaxation.

            <section className="news">Today the make-over of the Study/ Home Office reached its conclusion and after much running up and down stairs returning all
            the books, which had been having a holiday on the 2nd floor, the finishing touches were applied. We worked out that the height climbed
            up the stairs repeatedly was the equivalent of climbing a 366 meter (1,200 feet) fell!
            <br />
            <br />
            It has all been worth it though and we are very happy with the result. For anyone who may be interested, here are the before and after photos below.

  Today there was evidence of much tree-planting having been going on and re-wilding taking place. We also saw some new pond areas, with surrounding vegetation, on  which a couple of grey geese were seen to be resting happily....

            <br />
            <section className="news">
              We had a very interesting and pleasant day today, visiting a museum which we had long intended to see, and never until today got around to, the 'Devil's Porridge'
              Museum at Eastrigg, near Gretna Green, Scotland. The <Link to="https://www.devilsporridge.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="Click here to discover more about the Devil's Porridge Museum">Devil's Porridge Museum</Link>, recounts the 
              story of the huge ammunition factory based at Gretna in WW1 where the cordite (given the name 'Devil's Porridge') was made, and the stories of the people who lived and worked there. It is a popular museum, which receives good <Link to="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g2222050-d2216930-Reviews-The_Devil_s_Porridge_Museum-Eastriggs_Dumfries_and_Galloway_Scotland.html"
              target="_blank" title="Click here to read the reviews of the Devil's Porridge Museum">reviews</Link>.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              There were some really good aspects to the museum and how it has been set up and run which we really liked. The museum seemed to
              go out of its way to involve interested local young people who were working hard to make our visit an enjoyable experience, both serving in the entrance booth and also in the café. 
              It was also an interested group of local young people who went out to interview Bettie from Carlisle, who worked as a Landgirl in the Women's Land Army in Cumbria during the Second World War, and create 'The Story of a Landgirl' film which was shown at the museum and was very interesting, and also entertaining.
              More information about the making of 'The Story of a Landgirl' film with this group of young people, and Bettie's motivation in undertaking the project can be found in this <Link to="https://womenshistorynetwork.org/sharing-stories-of-women-in-war-betties-story-by-judith-hewitt-manager-of-the-devils-porridge-museum/"
              target="_blank" title="Click here to discover more about Bettie's Story">Women's History Network article</Link>. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Like most museums now, there were some fun, interactive sections. Bernard had a great time undertaking the simulated creation of cordite via an interactive game 
              which takes you through the various stages required to make the cordite and transport it safely.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Then it was on into Gretna village to park by the <Link to="https://www.gretnagreen.com/the-famous-blacksmiths-shop-a1034" target="_blank">Gretna Green Village Blacksmith's shop</Link>, which is the famous home of the <Link to="https://www.gretnagreen.com/traditions-of-a-gretna-green-wedding-a742" target="_blank"> anvil  wedding</Link> .

              Everyone seemed to have enjoyed the trip.
