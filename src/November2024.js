           Welcome to our November blog. This month we have created a virtual, animated bonfire and firework display for our Guy Fawke's party. This

           <br />
           <br />
                      For the winter months we have also included a colour scheme taken once again from an autumnal russet pallet in hex color coding.
           The display is created by amalgamating 3 separate container elements: the  burning bonfire animation, the animated firework display, 
           and the earth which forms the ground. We hope you enjoy it...

            <section className="newsNovember" style={{textAlign:"center"}}> We took the time today to go to see the temporary exhibition entitled 'Sycamore Gap: One Year On'
            by the artist Charlie Whinney which is being hosted at 'The Sill' between the 28th September and the 3rd November 2024. The Guardian newspaper recently 
            published an article regarding this exhibition which can be read here: <Link to="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/27/sycamore-gap-tree-exhibition-opens-to-mark-a-year-since-its-felling"

            <br />
            <br />
            The felling of the Sycamore Gap Tree in the early hours of the morning on the 28th September 2023 gained widespread media coverage with people from all over the world adding 
            their contributions as to the significance of this particular tree to their lives and experiences. As a result of this and in order to try and gain something hopeful and positive 
            out of such a destructive event, the artist Charlie Whinney and Creative Communities CIC, have created the Sycamore Gap: One Year On exhibition. 
            <br /> 
            <br />  
            This exhibition encourages contemplation of events and features the largest remaining section of the original tree. 
            As part of the exhibition, it seeks the participation of the public with visitors being invited to make promises to nature, which will be incorporated into the second and final phase of the commission, set to open by Easter 2025. 
            It is the first part of a 2 part exhibition in which the second and final part will see the wood installed permanently into The Sill and this will open by Easter 2025.
            <br /> 
            <br />  
            As part of the Trees of Hope initiative, all 15 UK National Parks will also receive a sapling that will find new homes 
            in some of the most beautiful landscapes in the UK.

             <section className="newsNovember" style={{textAlign:"center"}}>
           When we walked the Birdowswald Fort section of Hadrian's Wall on the 28th July 2024, there was not time to call in and explore the fort more fully, so we promised
           that sometime over the quieter Winter months we would pay Birdoswald Fort a visit, especially as Harry had never had the opportunity to visit.
            <br /> 
            <br />  
            It was lovely and quiet at the fort, so there was plenty of opportunity and time to study the information boards and findings carefully. 
            It is an interesting fort and well worth a visit if you are in the area! It is probably worthwhile obtaining a copy of the English Heritage guidebook 
            though as it contains some additional helpful information to provide further clarification.

              optional 'Haltwhistle Detour' of the Hadrian's Wall Path, usually used by people walking Hadrian's Wall who have overnight accommodation booked in Haltwhistle.
              This is one of the additional, optional add-ons to our Hadrian's Wall walk in the Summer, which we did not have chance to complete at the time, so what better time 
              to do it than now? Whilst it was misty, when the sun periodically broke through, it turned into a lovely day. It also made it apporpriately spooky,

              Street. It seemed to be popular with local people, which is always a good sign. Coffees complete, we set off on our walk up Haltwhistle Burn towards Cawfield's

              <br />
              <br />
              Haltwhistle Burn Gorge was formed millions of years ago. It contains large cliffs containing sandstone. It was an important source of coal, which was 
              mined, and limestone, which was burnt to form lime, used in buildings and had an important role in improving the acid soil of the upland farms. 
              The remains of 2 lime kilns are still visible as you climb the path. The footpath you walk on was, during the early 20th century, the narrow-gauge railway tank which transported road-stone from Cawfields Quarry on Hadrian's Wall,
              where we were walking today, to the railway sidings at Town Foot. Earlier, in the 18th century, there were 2 mills in the gorge which had been set up by the Quakers to created
              jobs for local people and which were used to produce wool. The gorge looks very peaceful today but it was once the industrial centre of Haltwhistle producing woollen fabric, coal, stone, lime and ceramics.

              we can comfortably walk 10-15 miles a day over successive days. The challenges of this over the winter period of course are the shorter daylight hours and risk of 
              inclement weather, so a prompt start and flexibility in consideration of the best routes will be important.
              The walk today was just under 10 miles, on mixed terrain, along small country roads, and through several woods. 
              <br />
              <br />
              Some highlights of the walk included:

              <ul style={{textAlign:"center", marginLeft:"5%", marginRight:"5%"}}>
                <li style={{textDecoration:"underline"}}>Milton Rigg Wood:</li> <div className="leftAlignli">Owned and managed by the Woodland Trust and containing a variety of interesting trees including many oak and birch, many of which date back 
            over 100 years. Oak from this wood was used in rebuilding the roof of York Minster after it was destroyed by fire in 1984. The wildlife pond was 
            created in 1990 as a habitat for toads, newts and dragonflies. There are birds such as wood warbler and willow tit which can be spotted.</div>
              <br />
              <br />
              <li style={{textDecoration:"underline"}}>Naworth Castle:</li><div className="leftAlignli">Naworth Castle, belonging to the Dacre and Howard families, was built in 1335 to defend England’s borderlands 
              against the Scots and Border Reivers. It is a private home, which is only available for private hire, and so it is not open to the general public.
              Nevertheless, it forms an impressive site as you descend the hill and it is easy to see why it was chosen for this location during the time of the borderland conflicts.</div>
              <br />
              <br />
              <li style={{textDecoration:"underline"}}>Lanercost tea room:</li><div className="leftAlignli">Lanercost tea room is adjacent to the fascinating 12th century Lanercost Priory and lies only 0.5 mile from the World Heritage Site of Hadrian’s Wall.
              They serve a good range of freshly-prepared food. As you may have realised by now, for those of you who follow the blog, it is a favourite location of ours....</div> 
              <br />
              <br />
              <li style={{textDecoration:"underline"}}>Quarrybeck:</li><div className="leftAlignli">A stream and falls running through woodland down towards Lanercost. This is an extremely pleasant walk, especially in the month of May
              when the bluebells are out. It can be very muddy underfoot though, so adequate footwear is necessary. Our May 2024 header features the bluebells in Quarrybeck wood.....</div>
              <br />
              <br />
              <li style={{textDecoration:"underline"}}>Ridgewood:</li><div className="leftAlignli">This also is an area of woodland owned and managed by the Woodland Trust. It has lots of wildlife including roe deer, red squirrel and foxes being seen.
              There is a large ancient beech with a girth of 4.2m can be found to the east together with other species such as sycamore and lime. There are some lovely views from up here.</div>
