            Welcome to our April 2024 blog launched from our new site! We hope
            you like the site's new look and improved functionality. Please note
            and bookmark the new web address which is displayed in your browser
            above.
            <br />
            <br />
            This month's theme is the local North Cumbrian Swaledale sheep in
            the area where we live and their very cute lambs who have been
            entertaining us, gambling around in the fields recently. Swaledale
            sheep are a breed of sheep named after the Yorkshire valley of
            Swaledale in England. In this area of Northern Cumbria, which is
            located in the Pennine fells of Cumbria, they are the main breed of
            sheep to be reared. They are especially suited to this area as they
            are very hardy, able-bodied, thick-coated and bold. More information
            about Swaledales can be found{" "}

            <br />
            For those people who may be interested, the April header design this
            month has been created from first-principals using Scalable Vector
            Graphics (SVG). Firstly, pictures were taken of the local Swaledale
            sheep and their lambs, then the mountains, sheep and lambs were
            carefully plotted and their colours and features matched as closely
            as possible. The new site uses React, a javascript library which
            allows a webpage to be described using small, reusable components.
            <br />
            <br />
            Meanwhile, the Easter weekend has brought us some pleasanter
            weather. The daffodils are in bloom in the village and people are
            out and about, smiling, cheerful and chatty, catching up on local
            news after the windy and wet early Spring. The daffodils are always
            lovely and the grass the fresh green of early Spring.

            In our 16th March blog entry, we went out to the Greek restaurant in
            Carlisle for our Mother's Day meal and we enclosed a photo of the
            very popular and well-known cat, whom the pet shop on Bank Street
            feeds and look after (see below for those people who missed the
            photos first time around).
            <br />
            <br />
            We have since discovered and regret having to announce that he sadly
            died peacefully of old-age 10 days later on the 26th March, 2024, at
            the grand old cat-age of 16 years. His name was Will and he had
            adopted Nixon's pet shop on Bank Street as his owners some years
            ago. He featured in a full article in the local paper which you can
            read by opening the link below and which tells how he used to sleep
            in the cat baskets and curl up on the counter near the treats :

            There are signs that Spring is arriving at last with the arrival of
            the blossom on the trees and the daffodils. Also just as
            importantly, the arrival of our first outing to meet with friends
            this year.
            <br />
            <br />
            An old favourite, Sizergh Castle in South Cumbria was selected as
            our venue, not least because it has a good café,{" "}
            <em>
              (we know, we know...it always seems to be about the café...but
              these things are important)
            </em>
            , and there are a range of walks with some spectacular views on
            offer.
            <br />
            <br />
            It was great to meet up with our friends, one of whom Jill has known
            since she was 11 years old and was bridesmaid at our wedding, and to
            catch up on news. There were some rainy showers, so for the first
            time we also looked around the interior of Sizergh Castle, which was
            worth seeing. It was very busy as it was still the Easter holidays.
            By after lunch the weather had brightened, though it remained quite
            stormy, so we worked out a relatively tree-free route up to{" "}

            Bay, the Lyth Valley and the distant Lakeland Fells.

            <br />
            Sizergh Castle remains one of our favourite National Trust
            properties, probably because of its size (it is relatively small),
            and the fact there are a variety of mixed-level walks which can be
            undertaken. It is also quite accessible, not being far off the M6
            Junction 36 exit. It is quite a popular location for visitors, as
            can be seen from the{" "}

            It was lovely to meet up in our home with our long-standing friends
            Pat and Dermot and their (quite crazy, but adorable) dog Archie
            today, and a good opportunity to catch up on all the news. We really
            enjoyed our day, walking about 6 miles. We saw plenty of lambs, but
            unfortunately not the ducklings on the tarn on this occasion.
            <br />
            <br />
            We had to have a pre-prepared plan for how we would manage Lennie
            for the day, as he is a little unsure about dogs, and we did not
            want it to turn out to be the trailer for 'Cats and Dogs 3' (a

            food from his bowl in the kitchen.... However, by the next morning
            Lennie seemed to have recovered ....(see photos below).

            . So that is all a bonus.
            <br />
            <br />
            Firstly, we explored the new, revamped Lowther Exhibition which
            tells the story of Lowther and has just been fully opened. We felt
            it has been done really well. In contrast to the design of the
            previous exhibition, the story of Lowther and its renovation is told
            through objects. The rooms are dark and the graphics gold. There is
            also an interesting video to watch. So this is well worth a visit.
            <br />
            <br />
            Then as we came out from within the Castle into the Parterre
            Gardens, we caught our first glimpse of the Durham artist Steven
            Massam's temporary exhibition 'Celebration in Gold'. It is on site
            until the 6th May 2024. More information about Steven Massam and
            this exhibition can be found in this BBC article{" "}

            <br />
            <br />
            The renovation of the Japanese Garden is nearing its completion. We
            have been watching its progress with interest for some months, but
            it is really lovely now and certainly a transformation on how it was
            before. It has been created to be an area of relaxation.

            It was a lovely sunny day today, although cold, and so we set out
            for a walk with the aim to see how we got on...the final result
            being that we ended up walking the full 6.5 mile circuit into the
            wilderness behind Talkin and the Tindale Fells, North Pennines and
            had a lovely afternoon.

            at the threats and opportunities in the Fellfoot Landscape, and

            Today there was evidence of much tree-planting having been going on
            and re-wilding taking place. We also saw some new pond areas, with
            surrounding vegetation, on which a couple of grey geese were seen to

            There were some really good aspects to the museum and how it has
            been set up and run which we really liked. The museum seemed to go
            out of its way to involve interested local young people who were
            working hard to make our visit an enjoyable experience, both serving
            in the entrance booth and also in the café. It was also an
            interested group of local young people who went out to interview
            Bettie from Carlisle, who worked as a Landgirl in the Women's Land
            Army in Cumbria during the Second World War, and create 'The Story
            of a Landgirl' film which was shown at the museum and was very
            interesting, and also entertaining. More information about the
            making of 'The Story of a Landgirl' film with this group of young
            people, and Bettie's motivation in undertaking the project can be

            Like most museums now, there were some fun, interactive sections.
            Bernard had a great time undertaking the simulated creation of
            cordite via an interactive game which takes you through the various
            stages required to make the cordite and transport it safely.

            Walk by the river Eden and through Coombs Wood, Armathwaite, Cumbria

          <section className="news">
            The walk from Armathwaite through Coombs Wood and the Longsdales has
            long been a favourite of ours, especially when we lived in the Eden
            Valley, when we walked this route regularly. However, following our
            move, we had not been here to walk since November 2022. It was a
            sunny, reasonably warm Spring day today and it was bluebell season,
            meaning the bluebells would be in flower in Coombs wood, so we
            decided to go walking here in the afternoon.
            <br />
            <br />
            We had forgotten how really lovely it is.{" "}

            is a small village situated at the crossing of the River Eden, with
            the most amazing bridge, which during the 2015 floods in Cumbria
            was, as we discovered from personal experience, one of the last
            bridges remaining open and safe to cross. We parked on the bridge,
            from where you can see the River Eden, which is renowned for its
            salmon fishing and{" "}

            , which with its 4-sided Pele tower, was built in the 15th Century
            to protect the Eden Valley from Scottish raiders.
            <br />
            <br />
            Descending by the bridge, we followed the lovely tree-lined footpath
            by the Eden, past Armathwaite Castle and up as far as the old mill
            weir, from where we started to ascend into Coombs Wood. On meeting
            the main bridleway through the wood, there is a lovely viewpoint
            looking down through the trees on to the River Eden, where there are
            some carved and sculpted stones (forming the stone sculpture{" "}
            <em>Vista</em>) to sit on. We made use of these for a momentary
            pause before continually ascending upwards through the wood.
            Eventually, we reached the top of the wood and exited on to the
            minor road leading into the Longsdales hamlet. From here we followed
            the bridleway which drops back down towards the road running between
            Armathwaite and Ainstable, with excellent views over to the Pennine
            ridge, including its highest point, Cross Fell. Once back on the
            road, we returned along this, dropping gradually down into
            Armathwaite village to end at one of our favourite pubs, the{" "}
